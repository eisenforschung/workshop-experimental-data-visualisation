Workshop: experimental data visualization

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/eisenforschung/workshop-experimental-data-visualisation/master)
## Who is this workshop for?
You are an experimental materials scientist.
You deal with images, spectra, diffractograms, EBSD maps, point clouds, mechanical test data.
Your primary toolchain consists of MS Excel, OriginLab, OIM, ImageJ, IVAS, DigitalMicrograph, and other proprietary software.

You are tired of the manual labor involved with endless clicking, and want to try your hand at automation and custom analysis.
You have thought about learning Python to help you with your research, but you never got around to it.
There are lots of resources on the web, but it's hard to see the forrest from the trees, and you don't have time to sort through it all.

## What is this workshop about?
The software taskforce has you covered.
In this first workshop, we will introduce you to the basics of data visualisation using Python, with workflows relevant to experimentalists.
We will teach you how to:

* Load in various experimental data files
* Perform basic operations and analyses on this data
* Make **publication ready** visualisations

The Agenda of the workshop includes:  
- Marvin Poul: Interactive dashboard to analyse/visualize the data from nanoindentation experiments - [notebook](https://github.com/pmrv/nanoindent-example/blob/d9d51924ec33b4a76969e54ec9eb1cfab488ab42/NanoIndentVoila.ipynb)
- Vitesh Shah: Introduction to matplotlib and reproducible data visualization - [notebook](https://github.com/eisenforschung/workshop-experimental-data-visualisation/blob/master/stress_strain_plots/Plot_stress_strain_curves.ipynb)
- Niels Cautaerts: Introduction to image analysis and plotting - [notebook](https://github.com/eisenforschung/workshop-experimental-data-visualisation/blob/master/image_analysis/Grain_size_analysis.ipynb)
